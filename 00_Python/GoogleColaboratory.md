## What is Google Colaboratory
[Colaboratory], or "Colab" for short, allows you to write and execute Python interactively in your browser. While I prefer you using python locally on your computer, Colab is an option.

Like any tool, there are advantages and disadvantages to using Google Colab. 

### Advantages
- You don't have to install anything locally on your computer
- It comes with a collection of many open source packages (NumPy, scikit-learn, scipy, and pandas to name a few)
- Provides browser-baed Jupyter Notebooks which allows for easy sharing and collaboration.
- Store notebooks on Google Drive
- Free access to GPUs and paid access to more powerful GPUs

### Disadvantages
- Google owns Colab. While it has always been free, it could in the future not be.  If it isn't in future, it is easy to switch to other tools. 
- You need a google account to use.
- Data loading can more difficult than if you installed python on your computer.
- Not much default RAM

In short, colab is free, easy to setup, and that is makes it easy to share notebooks which enables faster feedback to students. All of this makes it so you can get started on your journey quicker.
